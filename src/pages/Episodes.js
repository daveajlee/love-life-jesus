                            Prayer plays an important role in living a life with and for Jesus. We start this series on prayer by looking at an essential element of prayer which is often overlooked - thanking and praising God before we ask God for wisdom.
Psalm 117 encourages us to always praise God. It provides a short and easy to remember structure that we can use at the beginning of our prayers. 
In this episode, we will study Psalm 117 and at the end I will offer two tips how you can integrate Psalm 117 into your prayer life.
