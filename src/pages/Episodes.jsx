                            Prayer plays an important role in living a life with and for Jesus. We start this series on prayer by looking at an essential element of prayer which is often overlooked - thanking and praising God before we ask God for wisdom.
Psalm 117 encourages us to always praise God. It provides a short and easy to remember structure that we can use at the beginning of our prayers. 
In this episode, we will study Psalm 117 and at the end I will offer two tips how you can integrate Psalm 117 into your prayer life.

                            Prayer plays an important role in living a life with and for Jesus. We continue our series on prayer by looking at one of the most famous prayers in the bible - the Lord's Prayer.
                            The Lord's Prayer offers a template for our prayers and can help us maintain a healthy balance between praise and requests in our prayer life.
                            In this episode, we will study the Lord's prayer and at the end I will offer three tips how you can integrate the Lord's prayer into your prayer life.

                            Prayer plays an important role in living a life with and for Jesus. We continue our series on prayer by looking at another of the most famous prayers in the bible where Jesus prays for us.
                            John chapter 17 gives us an insight into how Jesus prays for us - what his prayer requests are and how we should pray for ourselves.
                            In this episode, we will study John chapter 17 and at the end I will offer a couple of tips how you can integrate these prayer requests into your prayer life.

                            Prayer plays an important role in living a life with and for Jesus. We complete our series on prayer by looking at how prayer helps us to care for others.
                            Hannah prays for a child but Eli thinks she is drunk. Through the story in 1st Samuel, we can learn a lot about how we can best care and pray for one another.
                            I hope this episode will help you to be able to support others in difficult situations and I will offer a couple of tips how you can integrate this into your prayer life.
